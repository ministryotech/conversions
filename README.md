A selection of extension methods to provide easy conversion between some of the primary data types.

- **Boolean.ToInt32** - Converts a boolean value to an integer with optional parameters to specify the translated true and false values.
- **Boolean.ToString** - Takes a defined type of conversion to convert a bool value into either True / False, Yes / No or Y / N strings.
- **Int32.ToBoolean** - Converts an integer greater than 0 into true.
- **String.ToBoolean** - Converts any valid string to a representative boolean value. The conversion is case insensitive and will take either 1 / 0 / -1, Yes / No, True / False or Y / N as valid input strings.
